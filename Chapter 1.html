<!-- These codes with '<>' brackets are known as tags and some tags are needed to be closed using a slash '</>'-->
<!-- You can use both 'htm' and 'html' extension but make sure you go with the second option because most of the web browsers support '.html' extension-->
<!-- HTML is a case insensitive language, which means it doesn't care whether you use tags in upper or lower case, they are meant to be ran by the browser once they are starting with '<>' -->
<!-- However it is recommended to use lower case -->
